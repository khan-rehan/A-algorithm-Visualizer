# A* Algorithm Visualizer

A python visualization of the A* path finding algorithm. It allows you to pick your start and end location and view the process of finding the shortest path.

A* is a modification of Dijkstra’s Algorithm that is optimized for a single destination.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm can find paths to all locations; A* finds paths to one location. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal.

It is more or less the golden ticket or industry standard algorithm for all applications finding directions between two locations.
